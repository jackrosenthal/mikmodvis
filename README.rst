mikmodvis
=========

This repository has a few programs: ``mikmodtest`` and ``mikmodvis``. Both of
them require ``ncurses`` and ``libmikmod``.

To compile, type ``make``.

To run, type ``./mikmodvis chiptune.it``, where ``chiptune.it`` is the path to
a chiptune in any format supported by MikMod. For example, try `this file`_.
